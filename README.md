# ARACHNE UI / DARWIN EU FORK

*This is the Arachne UI Fork of the Darwin EU CC, it contains modifications required for the DARWIN EU CC
The original readme is available in this folder*

## HOW TO RUN

Check the original readme, we are only using Arachne Portal (Central)

## HOW TO DEPLOY

When committing changes to the master branch of the Arachne Central API a build and release is triggered in Azure DevOps to the dev environment.
If you want to redeploy after making changes to the front-end you need to manually trigger one.
